# Brendan-Eich
Tech Project attempt #1

This is my Technology project that I hope to finish in the next 5 hours. 

The main objective of this game is to choose the right piece of code to complete the puzzle. 
To move your player piece, use the ARROW KEYS. 
To select an object, you will have to move your player piece to touch the right block of code.
If you choose the wrong one, you will know right away and to reset the game, click "R" on your keyboard.
If you choose the right piece of code, you will get a prize at the end.

Have fun and I hope you enjoy playing this short game I made about Brendan-Eich!
